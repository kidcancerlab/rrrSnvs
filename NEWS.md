# rrrSnvs 0.3.0
- Modified the distance calculation and output to report both all groups as well as the top level split for each tree.
- Added a new plotting function assemble_tree_plots() to read in the pngs written to the output folder and assemble them into a single plot. This will eventually be used to also add in dimplots and other visualizations for a final output figure.
- Updated the conda environment to include bcftools and samtools.

# rrrSnvs 0.2.0
- Updated the conda environment to include all the necessary packages for the
package.

# rrrSnvs v0.1.0
- Made a new repo for this code and stripped out the rrrSingleCellUtils code.
